## Features
 ### Existing features
* Header
  * The header, located on the top of the page displays the name of the game. Rock, paper, scissors is in generall a well known game and the user will most likely understand what the game is about just by seeing the name. If that is not the case, the rules are provided below the game area.

### Features left to implement
   * When there is time I would like to implement a feature where the user will, instead of receiving an alert box, would get a result message on the site it self and not from a pop up. The javaScipt code is created in a way so that if the score of either user or computer reaches five the score will not increment. This means that if a possible message would appear on the screen it could just have a prompt to press the reset score button and the game would work just fine.
